<h2>About me</h2>
As a 19-year old software development enthusiast, I experiment with Java, C#, Unity, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and SQL. I acquired the Diploma in IT (MQF Level 3) in February 2019 where I familiarized myself with website design and development and C# (mainly Windows Forms and Console .NET Framework). I am currently following my second and last year of the Advanced Diploma in IT (Software Development).

<h3>My goals before turning 20</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Exploring web scraping technologies via Selenium and C#/Java, as well as Beautiful Soup and Python.</li>
  <li>Continue working on my C# .NET library <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mauren" target="_blank">Mauren</a>. (This contains a lot of ready-made code to aid with string manipulation, arithmetic operations and user input)</li>
  <li>Enhance my <a href="https://github.com/mandyfarrugia2001/pacman" target="_blank">Pacman Unity project</a> by spawning dots and ghosts at runtime.</li>
  <li>Build a database managed system (maybe a COVID-19 tracking system).</li>
  <li>Inspire Maltese netizens to familiarize themselves with coding as I believe it hones critical thinking skills.</li>
</ul>
